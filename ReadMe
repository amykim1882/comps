Since this project requires quite a lot of downloads, please ensure that you have enough disk space
to fully download the github file, node.js modules, and npm install.

Before downloading the github file, please try running the commands in terminal:
node -v
npm -v

Your terminal should look like this once you try running the commands:


If something other than v12.9.0 shows up for the node -v command and something other than 6.14.8 
shows up for the npm -v command, then please go to this link https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and 
download node.js by following the instructions on the page. There are different node packages for 
download depending on whether you have a windows, mac, or source code installer. 

After downloading the node.js package, please check it has been correctly downloaded by running the 
two commands above again in terminal. The version packages should be v12.9.0 for node -v and 6.14.8
for npm -v. 

After verifying that the node.js package has been downloaded, please download the github zip file 
and open up your zip file on your desktop. In your terminal, please cd Desktop, then cd comps, 
and cd uno_finalcomps. The cd might differ depending on where you decide to move the comps folder. 
Once you cd to uno_finalcomps, please run the following command: npm install

The command above will download the necessary files to run this project and might take a while. 
After the download finishes, please run the command: npm run start

Congratulations! You have successfully executed this project! Please enjoy the text-based web 
application version of Uno!
