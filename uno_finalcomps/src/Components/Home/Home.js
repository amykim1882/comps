                    The rules are simple: try your best to discard all the cards that you are dealt.
                    Any cards left that are not accounted for will be used to rank your status using a unique point system: 
                    </p>
                    -20 points for every action card: skip, +2, reverse
                    <br/>
                    -50 points for every color changing card: wild +4, color change
                    <br/>
                    -face value for every corresponding number value card: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                    At any point, if you wish to restart the game, please press the "Restart Game" button located at 
                    the bottom of the game page.
